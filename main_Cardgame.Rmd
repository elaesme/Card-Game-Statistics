## Exercise 1:

1. Start by assuming the two players pick their sequences completely at random. Use the R function sample() – and all
the loops and data structures you like – to simulate N = 1000 times this game to show his undisputable fairness (under
these conditions at least).


```{r}
N <- 0
count_win_player1 <- 0 #count times of winning player 1
count_win_player2 <- 0 #count times of winning player 2
count_win_draw <- 0 #count times of draw

for(N in 1:1000) {
  cardList_forPlayers <- list() #create card list for just select players cards
  i <- 0
  
  for(i in 1:26) { #add R and B cards for desicion cards
    
    cardList_forPlayers <- c(cardList_forPlayers,"B")
    cardList_forPlayers <- c(cardList_forPlayers,"R")
  }

## Exercise 1:

2. Next consider the following weird strategy: when Player-1 has chosen his/her sequence, say RBR as above, Player-2
changes the middle color (in this case from B to R), adds it to the start of the sequence, discards the last color, and
announces the resulting sequence (in this case RRB). In general, this strategy gives a decided advantage to Player-2 no
matter which sequence his opponent has chosen. Here’s some numbers:

```{r}
N <- 0
count_win_player1 <- 0 #count times of winning player 1
count_win_player2 <- 0 #count times of winning player 2
count_win_draw <- 0 #count times of draw

for(N in 1:1000) {
  
  cardList_forPlayers <- list() #create card list for just select players cards

## Exercise 1:
3. Grab your phone + a stand, and make a short video of you and your homework partner, playing this game. You’ll upload the video and report here on the result of your games.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePIQdMetYlM&feature=youtu.be

In this video, we taken cards of player1 as RBB and cards of player1 as BRB for first example. Result of first example was draw (player1: 5-5 :player2 )
In second example we countinued with same cards of players and result was again draw (player1: 3-3 :player2 ).
After that we changed cars of players as BBB and RBB. The result of third example was winning by Player2(player1: 0-6 :player2 ). For last example we kept same cards of player and result was again winning by Player2.(player1: 0-6 :player2 ). We can understand that this game is not fair!


4. Quite impressive, uh? Try to explain this phenomenon at least qualitatively.


At first photo, you can see the most trivial solution. 2*2*2 there are 8 different sequences of first three cards, and we continue picking cards and see the first time a players routine holds, and at our explaination, the probability for player 2’s winning is: 6/8 so that’s why with this strategy there is an obvious difference of probabilitys of players winning the game, in player 2’s favor.
(You can find the photo inside the zip file named as photo1)

In the second photo, we tried to explain the algorithm using the probability of picking up the first 3 cards
(You can find the photo inside the zip file named as photo2)

##Exercise 2:
1. Using the R function rnorm() to generate the matrix L many times (say N = 1000), setup a suitable simulation study
to double-check the previous result. You must play around with different values of d, n,  and p (just a few, well
chosen values, will be enough). The sequence of indices (i1, . . . , in) can be fixed or randomized too, but notice that the
probability appearing in Equation (1) simply accounts for the uncertainty implied by the stochasticity of L – that’s why
I stressed that you must generate “many times” L. . .

##Exercise 2:
2. The main object being updated by the algorithm is the vector y. This vector consumes p ∼ log(n)/2 words of space,
so. . . have we achieved our goal? Explain:

The vector x consumes d number of words of space and the vector y consumes p ∼ log(n)/ep^2 number of words of space. Since d>n, d>log(n)/ep^2.
So we achieved our goal of dimensionalty reduction.
